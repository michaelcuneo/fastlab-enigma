      '<p>Contact Projects captures plant processes as bio-electrical activity, and visualises those signaletic movements as data. Tracing the bio-electrical impulses emanating from plants as sound and vision, we explore and express the limits of this unseen space. The performances afford a thinking through of the normally invisible connections plants make with us and use technology to transpose their inaudible frequencies to a range apprehended by the human ear.</p>',

      '<p>ArcanaOrrery Arcanais a system for real-time performance designed for a process analogous to automatic writing. The system includes custom software and a self-made hardware controller that is integrated with a planetary gear train, which gives the performer control over timing and sequenced events through manual gear rotations. Each gear is equipped with a sensor plate with embedded light, magnetic, and capacitive-touch sensors. The sensors are manipulated via concentric rings of colored acrylic and inset magnets that correspond to Tarot cards.The hardware controller is used to navigate systems that encompass chance operations, conceptual mapping, and data mapping to control audio generation and processing. These systems are based on NASA lunar data, the esoteric system in W.B. Yeats’A Vision(1937), and the numerology and symbolism of the Tarot. Yeats’ system inA Visionis situated in the centre, as it contains elements of both Tarot and lunar mapping. Sound sources include generated audio and samples of analogue synthesizers and environmental field recordings. nicolecarrollmusic.com/orrery-arcana/</p>',
