      '<p>Ars Electronica Newcastle Garden:  Novocastrian 2050: Ecosystem Reboot</p><p>Following last year’s brilliant 40-year festival, which brought more artists, exhibitors and international experts to Linz than ever before, this year Ars Electronica is going on a journey, or rather the festival itself is becoming a journey – a journey through “Kepler’s Gardens”. A journey through the networked biotopes and ecosystems in which people all over the world are working to develop and shape our future, and in these days that means above all working to save our future. A journey to and with many committed communities that have already begun not only to think about the current problems, but to work on concrete ideas, actions and solutions. Places, initiatives and institutions where artists and scientists work together, challenge society and try out new alliances and forms of cooperation.</p><p>Ars Electronica 2020 is a journey to measure the ‘new’ world and a journey through “Kepler’s Gardens”, which are located in Linz and at 120 other locations worldwide. In the course of this journey, the important questions of our time will be discussed, questions raised by the global corona crisis, and what we can and must do now will be considered. All the issues touched upon are marked by a general UNCERTAINTY and the question of how the crisis will shape and change us as individuals and as a society, us as HUMANITY. Two tensions in particular are in focus: AUTONOMY and DEMOCRACY as well as TECHNOLOGY and ECOLOGY.</p><p>Source: <a href="https://ars.electronica.art/keplersgardens/en/">https://ars.electronica.art/keplersgardens/en/</a></p>',

      '<p>The Biomes Ars Electronica Newcastle Garden virtual gallery is the nexus of activity for our exhibition.  It consists of four themed rooms branching from a single stem:  Wonderment, What went wrong? What can we do? and Future ecology. Take the time to browse and consider your contribution to biodiversity conservation in your everyday life. Click on the art for more information or to make a Biopledge.</p>',

      '<p>Ecology: more complex than a hyperweb. So complex in fact, it takes a faffle of disciplines to sort it out (ok – so faffle is not a real word). But why isn’t there a collective noun for disciplines? Biomes is an art science collaboration between the Faculty of Science and the Faculty of Education and Arts at the University of Newcastle with the desire to use the strength of diversity to tackle the wicked problem of biodiversity loss. This transdisciplinary and creative approach to conservation creates an engaging and immersive experience to empower the community to take their own action and to see their region as a living, sustainable and diverse community. Biomes is unique in that it addresses the human issues causing today’s climate emergency and biodiversity crisis by celebrating stories that bring biodiversity back from the brink of extinction. With mental and physical human health inextricably linked to our connection with the natural world, it is time to respect the nature and complexity of ecology.</p><p><b>KEY BIOMES MESSAGES</b><ul><li><p>Protect: We need to protect biodiversity because we are a part of it.</p><p>The message of our amazing and fragile biodiversity is presented through a number of art mediums – natural history illustrations, infographics about key threats, pre-recorded guest presentations and videos. A virtual gallery will capture a selection of our stunning art science exhibition pieces.</p></li><li><p>Participate: Everyone can participate in biodiversity conservation.</p><p>A number of high-profile Australian personalities and international scientists support BIOMES and make cameo appearances describing their contribution to biodiversity conservation (eg Kevin Rudd (former Prime Minister), Jimmy Barnes (Music legend), Joanna Griggs (Olympian and media personality) and Dr Karl (Media scientist). Additionally, in collaboration with Ars Electronica’s international online festival, Kepler’s Gardens, Biomes will host two art science thinking summits asking a key question about the future of ecology in Newcastle. Called the CQCs (Creative Question Challenge), these studio panels involve two participants, one visualiser and one moderator to develop new questions to challenge old thinking on ecological issues. These have been organised by Dr Kristefan Minski from Art Thinking Australia.</p></li><li><p>Despite being online because of the COVID pandemic, Biomes has worked with some of its key partners to produce a twitter event that encourages the Hunter community to get out and explore their local natural environment. Habitat Hunters is a weekly Twitter event that will profile a key biome (natural environment) and encourage people to visit these areas and record some of the amazing biodiversity at these sites. These citizen scientists will also be contributing to an important dataset about the location of threatened plants and animals in the region.</p></li><li><p>Produce: We can produce what we need sustainably</p><p>A message delivered at the corporate and personal level, Biomes uses an Instagram platform to deliver daily messages about simple actions an individual can take to contribute to biodiversity conservation. At the corporate level, artwork developed to showcase the role of Hunter Central Coast Development Corporation (HCCDC) in transitioning Newcastle from a post-industrial city to a vibrant sustainable city illustrates the concept that we can successfully manage the delicate balance between biodiversity and business.</p></li></li><p>Biomes was directed by Dr. Alex Callen, School of Environment and Life Sciences, curated by Dr. Bernadette Drabsch, School of Creative Industries, supported by Dr. Michelle Kelly, School of Psychology and designed by Dr. Simone O’Callaghan, School of Creative Industries. The Ars Electronica Newcastle Garden was managed by Dr. Kristefan Minski and the Mozilla Hub produced by Dr. Rewa Wright. The virtual gallery was created by FASTlab technical gurus Luke O’Donnell and Alex Barnes-Keoghan. Undergraduate and Post-Graduate students from Natural History Illustration, Visual Communication Design, Fine Art and Communication, together with the Conservation Science Research Group and the School of Psychology were instrumental in the development of the content, websites and videos. Comms students were supervised by Dr. Stuart McBratney.</p><a href="https://www.biomes.art/" text="https://www.biomes.art/">https://www.biomes.art/</a></p>',
