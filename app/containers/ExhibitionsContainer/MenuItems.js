      '<p>Ars Electronica Newcastle Garden:  Novocastrian 2050: Ecosystem Reboot</p><p>Following last year’s brilliant 40-year festival, which brought more artists, exhibitorsand international experts to Linz than ever before, this year Ars Electronica is goingon a journey, or rather the festival itself is becoming a journey – a journey through“Kepler’s Gardens”. A journey through the networked biotopes and ecosystems inwhich people all over the world are working to develop and shape our future, and inthese days that means above all working to save our future. A journey to and withmany committed communities that have already begun not only to think about thecurrent problems, but to work on concrete ideas, actions and solutions. Places, initiatives and institutions where artists and scientists work together, challenge society and try out new alliances and forms of cooperation.</p><p>Ars Electronica 2020 is a journey to measure the ‘new’ world and a journey through“Kepler’s Gardens”, which are located in Linz and at 120 other locations worldwide.In the course of this journey, the important questions of our time will be discussed,questions raised by the global corona crisis, and what we can and must do now willbe considered. All the issues touched upon are marked by a general UNCERTAINTYand the question of how the crisis will shape and change us as individuals and as asociety, us as HUMANITY. Two tensions in particular are in focus: AUTONOMY andDEMOCRACY as well as TECHNOLOGY and ECOLOGY.
